# Drowsiness-Detection
Drowsiness detection is a safety feature that can help prevent accidents caused by drivers who have fallen asleep behind the wheel. Countless people use the highway at all hours of the day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers, and long-distance travelers all suffer from sleep deprivation. As a result, driving when sleepy becomes extremely dangerous.
